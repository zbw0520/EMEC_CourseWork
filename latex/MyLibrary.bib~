	abstract = "Image classification is a complex process affected by some uncertainties and decisions made by the researchers. The accuracy achieved by a supervised classification is largely dependent upon the training data provided by the analyst. The use of representative training data sets is of significant importance for the performance of all classification methods. However, this issue is more important for neural network classifiers since they take each sample into consideration in the training stage. The representativeness is related to the size and quality of the training data that are highly important in assessing the accuracy of the thematic maps derived from remotely sensed data. Quality analysis of training data helps to identify outlier and mixed pixels that can undermine the reliability and accuracy of a classification resulting from an incorrect class boundary definition. Training data selection can be thought of as an iterative process conducted to form a representative data set after some refinements. Unfortunately, in many applications the quality of the training data is not questioned, and the data set is directly employed in the training stage. In order to increase the representativeness of the training data, a two-stage approach is presented, and performance tests are conducted for a selected region. Multi-layer perceptron model trained with backpropagation learning algorithm is employed to classify major land cover/land use classes present in the study area, the city of Trabzon in Turkey. Results show that the use of representative training data can help the classifier to produce more accurate and reliable results. An improvement of several percent in classification accuracy can make significant effect on the quality of the classified image. Results also confirm the value of visualization tools for the assessment of training pixels through decision boundary analysis.",

	abstract = "Artificial neural networks {(ANNs)} are biologically inspired computer programs designed to simulate the way in which the human brain processes information. {ANNs} gather their knowledge by detecting the patterns and relationships in data and learn (or are trained) through experience, not from programming. An {ANN} is formed from hundreds of single units, artificial neurons or processing elements {(PE),} connected with coefficients (weights), which constitute the neural structure and are organised in layers. The power of neural computations comes from connecting neurons in a network. Each {PE} has weighted inputs, transfer function and one output. The behavior of a neural network is determined by the transfer functions of its neurons, by the learning rule, and by the architecture itself. The weights are the adjustable parameters and, in that sense, a neural network is a parameterized system. The weighed sum of the inputs constitutes the activation of the neuron. The activation signal is passed through transfer function to produce a single output of the neuron. Transfer function introduces non-linearity to the network. During training, the inter-unit connections are optimized until the error in predictions is minimized and the network reaches the specified level of accuracy. Once the network is trained and tested it can be given new input information to predict the output. Many types of neural networks have been designed already and new ones are invented every week but all can be described by the transfer functions of their neurons, by the learning rule, and by the connection formula. {ANN} represents a promising modeling technique, especially for data sets having non-linear relationships which are frequently encountered in pharmaceutical processes. In terms of model specification, artificial neural networks require no knowledge of the data source but, since they often contain many weights that must be estimated, they require large training sets. In addition, {ANNs} can combine and incorporate both literature-based and experimental data to solve problems. The various applications of {ANNs} can be summarised into classification or pattern recognition, prediction and modeling. Supervised 'associating networks can be applied in pharmaceutical fields as an alternative to conventional response surface methodology. Unsupervised feature-extracting networks represent an alternative to principal component analysis. Non-adaptive unsupervised networks are able to reconstruct their patterns when presented with noisy samples and can be used for image recognition. The potential applications of {ANN} methodology in the pharmaceutical sciences range from interpretation of analytical data, drug and dosage form design through biopharmacy to clinical pharmacy.",
